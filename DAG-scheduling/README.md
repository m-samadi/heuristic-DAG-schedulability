# A library to test schedulability of the real-time DAG task model

## IMPORTANT NOTE
This repository is a fork from the original repository of ![DAG-scheduling](https://github.com/mive93/DAG-scheduling). It was created to fix some issues with deprecated TBB features. Some of the changes are:

* removes tbb::task_scheduler_init includes and uses
* completely copies the "np-schedulability-analysis" repository from ![gnelissen](https://github.com/gnelissen/np-schedulability-analysis)
   - the original repository uses a deprecated version from ![brandenburg](https://github.com/brandenburg/np-schedulability-analysis)
   - removes tbb::task_scheduler_init includes and uses
   - replace the use of SIGSTKSZ with 8192, as the current standard does not give an integer

## DAG-Scheduling library

This repo offers a library to handle the real-time Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) task model and its extensions, such as the Conditional DAG and the Typed DAG.
Moreover, several methods from real-time literature have been implemented. 
It's one of the contributions of Micaela Verucchi's Ph.D. thesis "A comprehensive analysis of DAG tasks: solutions for modern real-time embedded systems".

## Dependencies

For this repo the following libraries are needed: graphviz (for dot), libyaml-cpp-dev (to read yaml confi files) and python3-matplotlib (to plot the charts).
On Linux, install the dependencies in this way:

```
sudo apt-get install graphviz libyaml-cpp-dev python3-matplotlib libtbb-dev libeigen3-dev python3-dev


```

## How to compile this repo

Once the dependencies have been installed, build the project with cmake.

```
git clone https://github.com/tiagodrcarvalho/DAG-scheduling 
cd DAG-scheduling
git submodule update --init --recursive 
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make 
```

## Input and output

This library reads and outputs DAG in DOT format as shown in the image. 

![dot](img/dot_format.png "DAG with DOT") 

### Input

The library accept two input formats for taskse: yaml or DOT.

#### YAML format

A taskset is specified as an array of task, which has the following params
 * ```t``` the period
 * ```d``` the deadline
 * ```vertices``` array of nodes of the DAG, defined by: 
    * ```id``` id of the node
    * ```c``` WCET of the node
    * ```p``` core to which the node is assigned to [optional]
    * ```s``` gamma, the kind of engine the node is assigned to [optional]

An example is given with demo/taskset.yaml.
#### DOT format

Each DAG is defined via a DOT file, and each path of dot file belonging to the taskset should be written (line by line) in a txt file.
An example is given in demo/dot_files.txt

Each DOT file is the defined with this convention.
At the begninning there is an initial node with the info of the DAG Task, where the deadline ```D``` and the period ```T``` should be specified. For example: 
```i [shape=box, D=603.859, T=1605.45]; ```

Then each node is secified by an ID, a label which represent the WCET and additional optional parameters, as ```p``` and ```s```. For example:
``` 0 [label="57", p=7];```

Finally the edges are discribed only via nodes IDs. For example: 
``` 0 -> 2;```

A complete example is given in demo/test0.dot.

### Output

To convert a dot file into a png image use the following command: 

```
dot -Tpng test.dot > test.png
```

## Demo
The demo is a program that tests all the supported methods on user-defined DAG task set or a randomly generated one.
It can be executed as 

```
./demo <random-flag> <dag-file>
```

where
  * ```<random-flag> ``` can be set to 0 if the taskset should be read from file, or to 1 if the taskset should be randomly generated, using the method proposed by Melani et al. [1][2].
  * ```<dag-file>``` path to the file that describes the task set to analyze if ```<random-flag> ``` is set to 0.

## Eval
The eval program will evaluate several schedulability methods based on a given config file.
To run the evaluation execute:

```
./eval <config-file> <show-plots>
```
Where 
  * ```<config-file>``` is a yml file, like the ones in the data folder, that specifies all the parameters for the task set generation and the selection of the methods to evaluate. 
  * ```<show-plots>``` 1 to show plots, 0 to hide them. In any case, the resulting plots will not be shown but saved in a folder named res.

At the end of each evaluation two kinds of plots will be produced, one regarding the schedulability rate and one the execution times of the methods.
